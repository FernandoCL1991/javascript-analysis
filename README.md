The objective of this project is to create an HTML webpage that contains a table dynamically based upon a dataset of UFO sightings. Previously, both the back-end and front-end, were created using Javascript as the coding language as using D3 as the toolset for data manipulation- and queries made by the user.

This webpage will allow users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. Firstly, a UFO-sightings dataset was provided in a form of a JavaScript object and the task was to write a Javascript code that would append a table to the webpage and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting as per the result on each query.

Finally, CSS and Bootstrap were used to create the styling of webpage.
